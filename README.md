# Audio Repository

  

Welcome to my audio repository, where high-quality songs live purely for **educational purposes**. This is a *learning space*. Definitely not a haven for anyone looking to bypass paying for music.

### 🎵 Streaming Option for Emergencies Only

  

If, by some chance, you are having a **mild educational breathing emergency** — you know, when your knowledge-starved brain just can't cope without an MP3—you can stream the audio directly via this URL:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raccess21/Audio/main/...](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raccess21/Audio/main/...)

  

**Important**: This feature is ONLY for life-threatening moments where the lack of audio files might cause you to stop breathing (mildly). Please consult a professional (or not) before streaming.

  
  

### 📂 Playlists

  

-  **Playlists Folder**: Contains curated playlists for various moods and genres.

-  **Web Playlists Folder**: Contains `.m3u` files for seamless online streaming.

  

#### 🎶 How to Stream an Entire Web Playlist:

1. Navigate to the `web playlists` folder. 

3. Download the raw `.m3u` file of your choice.

4. Open it with a stream-supporting music player, like **VLC Media Player**.

## 🙏 Support the Artists

  

Artists work hard to create music, and it's important to support them… unless you’ve got a "justified educational emergency," of course. But seriously, if you like the songs, buy the albums. Or at least pretend you will.

### A Friendly Warning

  

If you download these files for anything other than educational purposes, hand of god will punish you for stealing, you’ll invite the wrath of *broken headphones and corrupted playlists*. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

  

But hey, who am I to judge? This is just a README, and you’re probably just an *eager student*, right?

  

Enjoy responsibly (*or not, whatever*). ✌️
