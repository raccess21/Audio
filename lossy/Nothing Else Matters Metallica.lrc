[01:05.41] Couldn't be much more from the heart
[01:10.66] Forever trusting who we are
[01:15.26] And nothing else matters
[01:20.50] 
[01:22.95] Never opened myself this way
[01:28.01] Life is ours, we live it our way
[01:32.87] All these words, I don't just say
[01:38.32] And nothing else matters
[01:43.34] 
[01:45.49] Trust I seek and I find in you
[01:50.83] Every day for us something new
[01:55.92] Open mind for a different view
[02:01.07] And nothing else matters
[02:08.79] Never cared for what they do
[02:13.41] Never cared for what they know
[02:18.51] But I know
[02:25.13] So close, no matter how far
[02:30.12] It couldn't be much more from the heart
[02:35.30] Forever trusting who we are
[02:40.19] And nothing else matters
[02:47.76] Never cared for what they do
[02:52.66] Never cared for what they know
[02:57.74] But I know
[03:02.70] 
[03:44.31] I never opened myself this way

[04:12.24] Every day for us something new
[04:17.41] Open mind for a different view
[04:22.45] And nothing else matters
[04:30.08] Never cared for what they say
[04:34.93] Never cared for games they play
[04:39.96] Never cared for what they do
[04:44.85] Never cared for what they know
[04:50.09] And I know, yeah, yeah
[05:02.60] 
[05:24.52] So close, no matter how far
