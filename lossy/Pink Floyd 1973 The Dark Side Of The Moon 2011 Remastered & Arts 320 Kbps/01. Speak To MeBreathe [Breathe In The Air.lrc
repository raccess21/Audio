Breathe, breathe in the air, don't be afraid to care
Leave, but don't leave me
Look around, chose your own ground
Long you live, and high you fly, smiles you give and tears you cry
All you touch and all you see is all your life will ever be
Run, rabbit, run, dig that hole, forget the Sun, and when at last the work is done, don't sit down, its time to dig another one
Long you live, and high you fly, but only if you ride the tide, balanced on the biggest wave, you race towards an early grave
