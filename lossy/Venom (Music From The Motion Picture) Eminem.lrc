[00:01.29]I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
[00:05.09]When the world gives you a raw deal
[00:07.37]Sets you off 'til you scream, "Piss off! Screw you!"
[00:10.91]When it talks to you like you don't belong
[00:13.11]Or tells you you're in the wrong field
[00:15.39]When something's in your mitochondrial
[00:17.72]'Cause it latched on to you, like-
[00:21.18]Knock knock, let the devil in
[00:22.80]Malevolent as I've ever been, head is spinnin'
[00:25.62]This medicine's screamin', "L-L-L-Let us in!"
[00:28.32]L-L-L-Like a salad bowl, Edgar Allan Poe
[00:30.96]Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
[00:34.06]Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
[00:37.54]Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
[00:40.47]Of elephant manure, hell, I meant Kahlï¿½a
[00:42.43]Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
[00:45.48]And blew up my-my-myself again
[00:47.70]Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
[00:50.93]Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
[00:53.72]Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
[00:56.79]How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
[00:59.74]Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
[01:03.56]Dr. Dre said, "Hell yeah!"
[01:05.12]And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man
[01:08.24]And I know they're gonna hate
[01:09.51]But I don't care, I barely can wait
[01:10.90]To hit 'em with the snare and the bass
[01:12.21]Square in the face, this fuckin' world better prepare to get laced
[01:14.62]Because they're gonna taste my-
[01:15.99]Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
[01:19.60]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[01:21.42]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[01:23.38]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[01:24.95]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
[01:26.78]They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
[01:28.59](W-W-When they get bit with the-)
[01:30.24]Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
[01:33.55]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[01:35.68]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[01:37.20]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[01:38.92]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
[01:40.76]They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
[01:42.79](W-W-When they get bit with the-)
[01:45.67]I said knock knock, let the devil in
[01:47.41]Shotgun p-p-pellets in the felt pen
[01:50.02]Cocked, fuck around and catch a hot one
[01:51.71]It-it's evident I'm not done
[01:53.42]V-Venomous, the thoughts spun
[01:55.32]Like a web and you just caught in 'em
[01:57.20]Held against your will like a hubcap or mud flap
[01:59.37]Beat strangler attack
[02:00.95]So this ain't gonna feel like a love tap
[02:02.64]Eat painkiller pills, fuck up the track
[02:04.50]Like, what's her name's at the wheel? Danica Patrick
[02:06.27]Threw the car into reverse at the Indy, a nut crashin'
[02:08.64]Into ya, the back of it just mangled steel
[02:10.88]My Mustang and the Jeep Wrangler grill
[02:12.63]With the front smashed, much as my rear fender, assassin
[02:15.18]Slim be a combination of an actual kamikaze and Gandhi (Gandhi)
[02:18.97]Translation, I will probably kill us both
[02:21.06]When I end up backin' into ya
[02:23.29]You ain't gonna be able to tell what the fuck's happenin' to ya
[02:26.76]When you're bit with the-
[02:27.51]Venom, adrenaline momentum
[02:30.51]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[02:32.09]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[02:33.69]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[02:35.66]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
[02:37.25]They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
[02:39.34](W-W-When they get bit with the-)
[02:40.74]Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
[02:44.41]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[02:46.14]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[02:47.97]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[02:49.64]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
[02:51.38]They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
[02:53.35](W-W-When they get bit with the-)
[02:56.21]I said knock knock, let the devil in
[02:57.95]Alien, E-E-Elliott phone home
[03:00.54]Ain't no telling when this chokehold
[03:02.33]On this game will end, I'm loco
[03:04.16]Became a Symbiote, so
[03:06.01]My fangs are in your throat, hoe
[03:07.80]You're snake-bitten with my, venom
[03:11.05]With the ballpoint pen I'm
[03:12.24]Gun cocked, bump stock, double-aught, buckshot
[03:14.22]Tire thumper, a garrote, tie a couple knots
[03:15.74]Fired up and caught fire, juggernaut
[03:17.07]Punk rock, bitch, it's goin' down like Yung Joc
[03:18.84]'Cause the Doc put me on like sunblock
[03:20.64]Why the fuck not, you only get one shot
[03:23.08]Ate shit 'til I can't taste it
[03:24.38]Chased it with straight liquor
[03:25.63]Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
[03:25.94]And awake with a headache
[03:27.91]And I take anything in rectangular shape
[03:29.91]Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
[03:32.76]'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
[03:34.58]So escapin' me is impossible
[03:36.23]I latch onto you like a parasite
[03:39.01]And I probably ruined your parents' life
[03:40.87]And your childhood too
[03:41.80]'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
[03:43.66]I'm responsible for you retarded fools
[03:45.30]I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
[03:47.90]You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
[03:49.67]And I'm the suit, so call me-
[03:51.31]Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
[03:55.09]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[03:56.79]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[03:58.54]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[04:00.31]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
[04:02.00]They ain't gonna know what hit 'em
[04:03.90](W-W-When they get bit with the-)
[04:05.54]Venom, (I got that) adrenaline momentum
[04:08.96]And I'm not knowin' when I'm
[04:10.87]Ever gonna slow up and I'm
[04:12.65]Ready to snap any moment I'm
[04:14.43]Thinkin' it's time to go get 'em
