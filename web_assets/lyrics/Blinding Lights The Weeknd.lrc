[00:15.89] 
[00:27.13] I've been tryna call
[00:29.88] I've been on my own for long enough
[00:32.65] Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
[00:38.23] I'm going through withdrawals
[00:41.17] You don't even have to do too much
[00:43.97] You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
[00:49.45] I look around and
[00:50.76] Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
[00:53.56] No one's around to judge me (oh)
[00:56.25] I can't see clearly when you're gone
[01:00.76] I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[01:06.62] No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[01:12.09] I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
[01:17.94] Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
[01:22.35] (Hey, hey, hey)

[01:36.98] 'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
[01:39.93] So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
[01:47.02] The city's cold and empty (oh)
[01:49.64] No one's around to judge me (oh)
[01:52.60] I can't see clearly when you're gone
[01:56.98] I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[02:02.87] No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[02:08.12] I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
[02:13.94] Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
[02:19.52] I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
[02:22.01] I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
[02:25.29] Will never let you go this time (ooh)
[02:30.51] I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[02:36.53] No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[02:40.77] (Hey, hey, hey)
[02:44.04] 
[02:51.95] (Hey, hey, hey)
